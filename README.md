# Bssentials [![Build Status](https://ci.codemc.org/buildStatus/icon?job=IsaiahPatton%2FBssentials)](https://ci.codemc.org/job/IsaiahPatton/job/Bssentials/)

Bssentials version 3.x is a rewrite of Essentials made to be more optimized & fix alot of bugs.

## What is Bssentials
Bssentials is a total remake of Essentials from the ground up!
We do our best to provide a great remake of Essentials.

## Why use Bssentials instead of EssentialsX?
Essentials was created 8 years ago, and the codebase is a mess.
So such a mess with unnessary code, that it took EssentialsX a long time for the 1.13 changes.
Essentials is also filled with proformance issues & bad practices.

Remaking Essentials from the ground up also gives us the ability for better proformance & less resource-intensive,
with newer functionaly.

## Building
To Build with Maven, use the command ```mvn package```
To build with Eclipse simply make sure you have the ```Spigot-API.jar``` added to the classpath & export normaly.

## Compatability
The EssentialsBridge provides support for the Essentials API
The "EssentialsBridge" module is a compatability layer between the Essentials API & Bssentials.
Plugins like **Vault**, **ChestShop**, **GroupManager**, **EssentialsChat**, and others that depend on Essentials
will work with Bssentials with out any modifications to them due to the [EssentialsBridge](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/essentialsapibridge)
