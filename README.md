Bssentials 3.x

## Bssentials 3?
Bssentials version 3.x is a rewrite of Bssentials made to be more optimized & fix alot of bugs.
The "EssentialsBridge" module is a compatability layer between the Essentials API & Bssentials.

## What is Bssentials
Bssentials is a total remake of Essentials from the ground up!
We do our best to provide a great remake of Essentials.

## Building
To Build with Maven, use the command ```mvn package```
To build with Eclipce simply make sure you have the ```Bukkit.jar``` added to the classpath & export normaly.

## Compatability
The EssentialsBridge provides support for the Essentials API
(note: ChestShop 3 does not work, please report to ChestShop and use the unoffical ChestShop 4.0-r5 or ChestShop 2)
